# LOLCODE Interpreter in Python 🐱‍💻


## 📊 Project Overview

This LOLCODE interpreter processes code written in the meme-inspired LOLCODE language. It supports variable handling, arithmetic, logical operations, and conditional statements using a multi-phase structure: Lexical Analysis, Parsing, and Evaluation.

## 🔗 How the LOLCODE Interpreter Works

The interpreter reads and executes LOLCODE source files through a series of well-defined steps:
- Lexical Analysis - Break source code into tokens.
- Parsing - Validate token sequences and construct internal representations.
- Evaluation - Execute instructions using variables, expressions, and control flow.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Design and build a functional LOLCODE interpreter.
- Learn about lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation.
- Practice team collaboration using version control (Git).
- Create well-structured documentation and test cases.
- Optionally, add bonus features like nested expression parsing, error reporting, and GUI support.

## ✅ Features to Implement

- *Program start/end:* HAI, KTHXBYE
- *Variable declaration:* I HAS A var, optionally with ITZ <value>
- *Assignment:* var R <value or expression>
- *Input/Output:* VISIBLE, GIMMEH
- *Data types:* NUMBR (integer), NUMBAR (float), YARN (string), TROOF (boolean)
- *Arithmetic operations:* SUM OF, DIFF OF, PRODUKT OF, QUOSHUNT OF, MOD OF, BIGGR OF, SMALLR OF
